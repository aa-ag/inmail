### InMail

Gonna try to use Python + Selenium to delete all of the InMails on my LinkedIn account.

Unsure bout this and LinkedIn's Terms of Service.  Not to be used for malicious purposes.  Only trying to see how this could be achieved for educational reasons.

Elements of the navigation flow are automatically hidden, which makes everything a lot harder.

#### env

- `conda create -n inmail`
- `conda install -c conda-forge python`
- `conda install -c conda-forge selenium`
- `brew install geckodriver`
